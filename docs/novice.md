# I am not a coder, what should I choose?
Everyone began from something (: Actually the language in this task doesn't matter, as the script is very simple.
You can search smth similar to "write hello world script in *language_of_interest* ".

If all of the languages are checked, and the requirements (about programming language variety) are satisfied, you are free to choose whatever language you like. A good start is to become more familiar with R or Python. Both of these languages are extremely popular within the bioinformatics community. See templates for "Hello world script" for [R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hello-world-in-r-programming/) and [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello,_World!).
