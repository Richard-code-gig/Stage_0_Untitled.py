# Unified template for output
Human text is an excellent example of unstructured data. Desired fields (for this task) can be printed out in many different ways. Therefore I propose a unified template for your script output:
```bash
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
USED LANGUAGE: *Name of used scripted language. All letters are capital*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose. The only first letter is capital* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
```
An example:
```bash
NAME: Pavlo Hrab
E-MAIL: pavlo.hrab@lnu.edu.ua
USED LANGUAGE: JULIA
BIOSTACK: Genomics
SLACK USERNAME: @pavlo 
```
**After you get the desired output, please name your file _stage_0_slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
`stage_0_pavlo.jl `
